Personal Development Portfolio - Academic Activity
Project Description
This is a responsive professional portfolio developed as part of an academic activity. The main goal was to customize an official Bootstrap template and learn how to publish it using GitHub Pages.

Original Template
The project was built based on the Pricing template from Bootstrap 4.0.

Customizations
Visual: I changed the color palette to a modern style with dark tones.

Content: I adapted the original layout to display my fictional projects and personal information, such as skills and contact.

Deploy
The website is published on GitHub Pages and can be accessed at:
